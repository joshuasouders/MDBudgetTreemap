This is a quick and dirty D3 treemap for visualizing the appropriations budget for the state of Maryland. The ETL/data is subpar and in need of a major refactor (which was accomplished in a later project with FME), but it was decided that a D3 bubble chart would make more sense so this visualization was abandoned. It's still cool though. It builds heavily off of http://bost.ocks.org/mike/treemap/ with some major edits to fit our needs as well as a few bugfixes.
